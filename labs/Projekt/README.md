## Project objectives

Official assigment: "Measuring the speed of an object through a series of IR sensors (such as HW-201) or optical barriers."

After consulting with the project assignee, it was specified that the object is to pass by at least 4 sensors connected to 
the NEXYS A7-50T board and it's speeds (speed in each "sector" between individual sensors) would be calculated and displayed on NEXYS's 7segment displays.
